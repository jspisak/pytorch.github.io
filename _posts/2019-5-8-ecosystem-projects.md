# PyTorch Adds New Community Projects

The PyTorch ecosystem consists of projects, tools, and libraries from a broad set of researchers in academia and industry, application developers, and ML engineers. The goal of this ecosystem is to support, accelerate, and aid in your exploration with PyTorch. Since the beginning of the year, we've seen some innovative projects join the PyTorch community. From private AI to quantum computing, we continue see the community expand to new and interesting areas. In this post, we would like to give some context on the criteria we use to evaluate community projects, how projects fit within the overall stack and some of the projects that have been added since the beginning of the year.  

When we review applications to join the PyTorch ecosystem, we take into account a number of key factors that we feel are important to consider and that we ourselves would want in the projects we ourselves use. 

1. **Well tested** - Users should be confident that ecosystem projects will work well with PyTorch and include support for CI ensuring that testing is occurring on a continuous basis
2. **Clear utility** - Users should understand where each project fits within the PyTorch ecosystem and the value it brings
3. **Permissive licensing** - Users are able to utilize ecosystem projects without licensing concerns
4. **Easy onboarding** - Projects will have support for binary installation options (pip/Conda), clear documentation and a rich set of tutorials (ideally built into Jupyter notebooks)
5. **Ongoing maintenance** - Commitment from the authors to support and maintain these projects
6. **Community** - A growing and broad based community


Below is roughly how we see the project categories:

 (1) *Data* - processing, ingest or format support e.g. Petastorm

 (2) *Performance* - graph optimization, compilers or kernel libraries e.g. Glow

 (3) *Core* - the core PyTorch 1.0 framework including domain APIs such as Torchvision 

 (4) *Domain frameworks* - frameworks developed for a particular field of research e.g. AllenNLP, botorch 

 (5) *Application specific platforms* - libraries or frameworks specific to end applications e.g. ELF OpenGO

 (6) *Production* - model serving, parameter tuning and optimization, management layers e.g. Ax

 (7) *Visualization* - model understanding, debugging, monitoring e.g. Tensorboard, Vizdom


## Newly added projects

[Skorch](https://github.com/skorch-dev/skorch) - skorch is a high-level library for PyTorch that provides full scikit-learn compatibility.

[PyTorch Geometric](https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_geometric) - PyTorch Geometric is a library for deep learning on irregular input data such as graphs, point clouds, and manifolds.

[PySyft](https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft) - PySyft is a Python library for encrypted, privacy preserving deep learning.

[PennyLane](https://pennylane.ai/) - PennyLane is a library for quantum ML, automatic differentiation, and optimization of hybrid quantum-classical computations.

[Flair](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/flair) - Flair is a very simple framework for state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP).

Again, the goal of this ecosystem is to support, accelerate, and aid in your exploration with PyTorch. If you'd like to have your project included in the PyTorch ecosystem and featured on [pytorch.org/ecosystem](http://pytorch.org/ecosystem), please complete the form [here](https://pytorch.org/ecosystem/join).
